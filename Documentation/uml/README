uml.sty is a package for writing UML (Unified Modelling Language) 
diagrams in LaTeX. Currently, it implements a subset 
of class diagrams, and some extra constructs as well. 
The example on the right hand demonstrates the 
Schema constructs. 

Run the Makefile or alternative:

latex uml.ins
latex uml.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist uml
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o uml.gls uml.glo
latex uml.dtx
dvips uml.dvi
ps2pdf uml.ps


This version of uml uses the extended version of the keyval 
package. So be sure that you 
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey.tex
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after uml, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex
