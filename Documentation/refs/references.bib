	abstract={The traditional lighting control system has many defects such as poor energy-saving effect , comfort , management and control technique. What's more troublesome wiring is also a problem. This paper is based on the ZigBee wireless technology and designed a low-power dissipation intelligent node control hardware platform.Which used the MSP430F2619 for processor of TI company, CC2430 RF( Radio Frequency) chip and silicon controlled dimming circuit. It is designed with software that has different lighting modes according to the different environments.The design achieved the brightness autoregulation of light in different environment- s.Therefore create a comfortable household environment.},

	abstract={This study examines the influence of illuminance variation on visual perception and mood in a small office. Field measurements and annoyance tests were performed in a full-scale mock-up office space. Subjects conducted paper-based and computer-based reading tasks when six instantaneous fluctuation ranges were given under 500?lx and 650?lx base level conditions. Results indicate that equal amounts of instantaneous illuminance fluctuation could influence visual perception differently under these two base level conditions. Visual annoyance under the 500?lx base level was more severe than that under the 650?lx base level. The acceptable illuminance fluctuation ranges that did not cause visual annoyance under 500?lx base level conditions were 141.3?lx for paper-based tasks and 187.3?lx for computer-based tasks. Under 650?lx base level conditions, the acceptable ranges were 200.3?lx and 252.4?lx for paper-based and computer-based tasks respectively. The mean mood and perception responses for visual thresholds under the 650?lx base level showed more positive feelings than those under the 500?lx base level. Multiple linear predictive models showed that feelings of visual sensitiveness to illuminance variation, visual distraction, and stimulation were significant contributors to visual annoyance under fluctuating illuminance conditions.},

	abstract = 	 {A questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate the effects of daylighting and human behavior patterns on subjective luminous comfort in Hong Kong housing units. The participants were recruited via mail, and included residents of both public and private housing units. 340 questionnaires were returned and analyzed by using SPSS 19.0. In analyzing the response statistics, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, Chi-square test, Kruskal–Wallis test and stepwise regression were adopted to identify the effects of particular aspects of human behavior and daylighting quality. The results confirmed that luminous comfort is a function of both behavior patterns and daylighting conditions. Behavior factors have a significant influence on luminous comfort among people who grade their satisfaction with daylighting as moderate. In general, the degree of luminous comfort is most affected by satisfaction with daylighting. External obstruction is the major physical factor affecting luminous comfort, while the perception of uniformity is the major factor of residents' feelings toward daylight. The use of artificial lighting is the most relevant behavior factor affecting luminous comfort, as using artificial lighting for many hours per day indicates poor daylighting conditions and decreased luminous comfort. These results should help to raise awareness of the detailed factors that influence the luminous environment. Our findings may also assist planners and architects to implement better daylighting for housing projects and provide residents with greater luminous comfort. "},

	abstract={This study investigated the effects of indoor lighting on occupants? visual comfort and eye health and to contribute to the management and maintenance of buildings. The illuminance of the working plane and windows at Samsung Corporation Headquarters were measured, and 2744 healthy occupants of Samsung Corporation were surveyed regarding the indoor lighting environment via the company?s intranet for 1½ years. This building was certified with the highest ranking by Korea?s Green Building Council. The cumulative data reflected the management and maintenance of the building, such as screen-type shading devices automatically controlled by seasons and time, improvement of visual display terminal glare by the veiling reflection on monitors, efficiency of artificial lighting arrays, and so on. The data were analysed for occupants? visual comfort and eye health. The result showed that daylighting could improve the occupants? psychological health and productivity. The screen-type shading device could intercept direct sunlight and reduce annoyance glare. However, the indoor lighting and visual environment of the building were poor. After examining the questionnaire feedback concerning improvements, the occupants? annoyance ratio was significantly reduced, and approximately 5% of the occupants? annoyance ratio was deemed to be caused by personal characteristics related to the lighting of the environment.},
